            <p>U.S.-ASEAN Connect is a new strategic, unifying framework to deepen the United States’ growing economic cooperation with ASEAN. President Obama announced Connect on February 15, 2016, at the U.S.-ASEAN Leaders’ Summit in Sunnylands, CA. Connect will support regional integration efforts of the new ASEAN Economic Community and build upon the positive economic ties between the U.S. and ASEAN. Together, ASEAN countries are the fourth-largest trading partner for the United States supporting millions of jobs in the region and in America. U.S. businesses are the largest cumulative source of FDI in ASEAN.</p>
